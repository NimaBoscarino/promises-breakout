## Async Review

Quick recap of ASYNC behaviour!

- What does Async mean?
    - code executing in parallelâ€©
    - this code may run now, or later!
    - synchronous code runs in order, right now!
- What are some examples of async actions?
    - setTimeout

```js
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('asdasdasd')
}, 2000)
console.log('aksdgakjsdgakjd)
```

    - network request
    - filesystem stuff
    - database
    - attaching event listeners

- How do we deal with asynchronous behaviour?
    - callbacks
    - Promises (totally, we'll look at this)

- What do we do if we want to queue up multiple async actions?

```js
callback
    callback
        callback
            callback
```

- What does error handling look like in these scenarios?

```

```

## Intro to Promises

A promise is a VALUE (as opposed to a currently running function) that will RESOLVE or REJECT at some point in the future.
